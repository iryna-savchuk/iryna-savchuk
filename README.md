<h3 align="center">AI Software Engineer | Data Scientist | PhD Student</h3>

I am an AI-focused software developer and Data Science professional with 5+ years of professional experience. For the past 3.5 years, I have been focused on designing and deploying AI-driven solutions, including ML systems, DL models, and intelligent automation pipelines. Before that, I worked primarily as a Data Analyst, focusing on data exploration, data quality, statistical modeling, and building decision-support tools.

My work spans multiple domains, including digital healthcare, e-commerce, AutoML platforms, and fraud detection systems.

I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics from <a href="https://karazin.ua/en/" target="_blank">Kharkiv National University</a> in Ukraine, and a Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics from <a href="https://www.novaims.unl.pt/en/" target="_blank">Nova IMS</a> in Lisbon. Currently, I am a PhD student at Nova IMS, pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Information Management with a specialization in Data Science and AI.
